Intrusion Detection System in NSL-KDD dataset
In the realm of cybersecurity and network intrusion detection, the NSL-KDD dataset stands as a benchmark for evaluating machine learning models' performance. This dataset, derived from the original KDD Cup 1999 dataset, addresses the limitations and biases present in its predecessor, making it a vital resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
